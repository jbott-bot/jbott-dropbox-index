= dropbox-index.py

This is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/kosciak-misc/wiki/DropboxIndex[DropBoxIndex]
to be used with jbott. Fixes/changes made to make it more efficient with large ever updating
filesystems/directories.

Changes:
 * Only generate index files if index.html is older than any file/folder in the dir
 * Use --force or -F to override
